# RabbitRunner
RabbitRunner is a Python-based solution that leverages RabbitMQ to handle task queues and message passing efficiently. Ideal for systems that need high performance, asynchronous task execution, and real-time communication, RabbitRunner simplifies distributed computing by providing an easy-to-use interface for managing messages and tasks.

# Features
- Queue Management: Seamlessly create and manage RabbitMQ queues.
- Message Passing: Enables fast, reliable communication across distributed services.
- Asynchronous Execution: Processes tasks asynchronously, ideal for microservices and background job processing.
- Scalable Architecture: Easily scales up to handle increasing workload by adding more consumers.

# Installation
Clone this repository and install the required packages:

```bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RabbitRunner.git
cd RabbitRunner
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Ensure RabbitMQ is running on your system, either locally or on a remote server.

# Usage
Configure RabbitMQ Settings: Adjust RABBITMQ_HOST, RABBITMQ_PORT, and other parameters in the configuration file.

# Starting a Producer:
Use the producer.py file to send messages to the queue.

```bash
Copy code
python producer.py
```
# Starting a Consumer:
Run the consumer.py script to process tasks from the queue.

```bash
python consumer.py
```
RabbitRunner handles sending and receiving messages, allowing developers to focus on task processing logic.

# Examples
To enqueue a task:

```python
from producer import send_message

send_message("task_queue", "Process this task")
```
To process messages:

```python
from consumer import start_consuming

start_consuming("task_queue")
```
